# Claude Code Plugin Skills Not Registering

## Problem

Skills in the webworks-claude-skills plugin were not being registered with Claude Code's Skill tool. Attempting to invoke any skill resulted in:

```
Unknown skill: webworks-claude-skills:automap
```

All four skills (automap, epublisher, markdown-plus-plus, reverb2) were affected.

## Root Cause

The `plugin.json` file was in the **wrong location**. Claude Code expects plugin configuration to be in a `.claude-plugin/` subdirectory.

**Incorrect (not working):**
```
plugins/webworks-claude-skills/
├── plugin.json              ← WRONG
└── skills/
```

**Correct (working):**
```
plugins/webworks-claude-skills/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          ← CORRECT
└── skills/
```

## Investigation

Compared the webworks-claude-skills plugin structure against the working compound-engineering plugin:

| Plugin | plugin.json Location | Skills Working? |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| compound-engineering | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Yes |
| webworks-claude-skills | `plugin.json` (root) | No |

The compound-engineering plugin cache showed the expected structure:
```
~/.claude/plugins/cache/every-marketplace/compound-engineering/2.22.0/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
```

## Solution

### 1. Move plugin.json

```bash
mkdir -p plugins/webworks-claude-skills/.claude-plugin
git mv plugins/webworks-claude-skills/plugin.json plugins/webworks-claude-skills/.claude-plugin/
```

### 2. Update plugin.json Schema

Changed from simple string author to object format matching Claude Code's official schema:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "name": "webworks-claude-skills",
  "version": "2.0.8",
  "author": "Quadralay Corporation",
  "skills": [
    { "name": "automap", "path": "skills/automap" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "name": "webworks-claude-skills",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Quadralay Corporation",
    "email": "support@webworks.com",
    "url": "https://github.com/quadralay"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/quadralay/webworks-claude-skills",
  "repository": "https://github.com/quadralay/webworks-claude-skills",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

**Key changes:**
- Removed explicit `skills` array (skills are auto-discovered from `skills/*/SKILL.md`)
- Changed `author` from string to object with name/email/url
- Added `homepage`, `repository`, `license` fields
- Bumped version to 2.1.0

### 3. Update Marketplace Version

Updated `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` version from 2.0.8 to 2.1.0 to match.

### 4. Fix GitHub Actions Workflow (Secondary Issue)

After the plugin.json move, the version-bump workflow broke because it referenced the old path.

**File:** `.github/workflows/version-bump.yml`

Updated 3 path references:
```yaml
# Before
plugins/webworks-claude-skills/plugin.json

# After
plugins/webworks-claude-skills/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
```

## Verification

After the fix:
1. Clear plugin cache: Delete `~/.claude/plugins/cache/webworks-claude-skills`
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Test skill invocation: `webworks-claude-skills:automap`

All four skills now register and are invokable.

## Key Learnings

1. **Plugin structure matters**: Claude Code requires `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, not `plugin.json` at root
2. **Skills are auto-discovered**: No need for explicit `skills` array - Claude scans `skills/*/SKILL.md`
3. **Author must be object**: String format doesn't match official schema
4. **CI/CD paths cascade**: When moving config files, update all workflow references
5. **Compare to working examples**: The compound-engineering plugin served as the reference implementation

## Prevention

### Pre-commit Check
Verify plugin.json exists at correct path:
```bash
test -f plugins/*/\.claude-plugin/plugin.json || echo "ERROR: plugin.json in wrong location"
```

### CI/CD Validation
Add workflow step to validate plugin structure before merge.

### Documentation
Always document the correct plugin structure for new developers.
