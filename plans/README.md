# Plans

Implementation plans for features and improvements.

## Workflow

**For new work:** Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/quadralay/webworks-claude-skills/issues) first, then optionally create a detailed plan here for complex implementations.

**Naming convention:** `issue-{number}-{description}.md` or `{description}.md` for pre-issue exploration.

## Archive

Plans created before the repo went public remain here for historical context. They document early design decisions and implementation rationale.
